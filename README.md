**Project Overview**
The primary goal is to classify facial expressions from images using a deep learning model. EfficientNet, a powerful CNN architecture, is fine-tuned for multi-class classification in this application, identifying one of seven predefined facial expressions.

**Requirements**
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
Torchvision
timm (PyTorch Image Models)
NumPy
Matplotlib
tqdm
PIL (Pillow)

Dataset
Training Folder: images/train/
Validation Folder: images/validation/
Each folder contains subdirectories for each class label (angry, disgust, fear, etc.), each containing respective images. Update the paths in the code if necessary.

**Project Structure**
**Data Augmentation:**
Dynamic data augmentation using random horizontal flips and rotations is applied to the training set to improve model robustness.
Model Definition:
FaceModel class wraps an EfficientNet model from the timm library, customized with 7 output classes.
Training and Evaluation:
train_fn() and eval_fn() are functions to train and validate the model.
multiclass_accuracy() calculates accuracy for multi-class predictions.
**Inference:**
predict_expression() loads an image, processes it, and predicts its facial expression label using the trained model.
**Results**
After training, the model will save the best weights in best-weights.pt. Use the accuracy and loss plots to assess model performance over the training and validation sets.
